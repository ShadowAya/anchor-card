> There is currently no way to scroll to specific points in your dashboard. This card fixes this and acts as an anchor you can scroll to.

### Known issues

~~When navigating within the same page, a new entry for the same URL gets pushed into history. It's not possible to remove history entries, so the same page URL will appear in your history multiple times.~~

~~Example: when you navigate to "kitchen" and then to "kitchen - lights" and then "kitchen - covers", you'll have to go back three times to leave the "kitchen" page, instead of one~~

~~I am currently working on a workaround~~

update: a `backout` option has been added that will go back multiple times for you. Check Usage for more info.

## Usage

To use the `anchor-card`, you need to configure it with the following parameters:

1. **anchor_id**: An identifier unique to each page.
   - This allows you to scroll directly to this card by using the URL parameter `anchor`.
   - **Example**: To scroll to a card with an `anchor_id` of "lights", your URL would look like this: `lovelace/0?anchor=lights`

2. **negative_margin**: Adjusts the card's top-down margin for visual spacing.
   - Default value: `13`.

3. **timeout**: Specifies the waiting time before scrolling to the card.
   - Useful in cases where other cards might take longer to render.
   - Default value: `150` (in ms).

4. **offset**: Determines the scroll offset.
   - Default value: `0`. It can also be set to a negative value to adjust the position as well.

5. **disable_in_edit_mode**: Set to true to prevent scrolling when edit=1
   - Default value: `true`

6. **backout**: This option will prevent having to go back multiple times if you navigate within the same page. When going back, the anchor will continue going back as long as it sees the URL hasn't changed
      - Default value: `false` \
        it's better to use this only on the anchors on pages that need it, and on **all the anchors on that page** \
        *this option is new, so please report any issues you encounter*

7. **transition**: Set a custom transition duration
      - Defaults to browser provided 'smooth' transition

### Configuration Example:

Here's an example configuration for the `anchor-card`:

```yaml
type: "custom:anchor-card"
anchor_id: lights
negative_margin: 10
timeout: 200
offset: -5
backout: true
```

Replace the values in the example with your desired settings, and add the card to your Lovelace dashboard.

## Installation
